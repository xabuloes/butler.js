Voice-Controlled Personal Assisstant as a Web Application

butler.js is a web-based personal assisstant application, that is controlled solely by voice interaction

Its modular architecture allows the custom integration of several REST-APIs that allow knowledge retrieval (Wikipedia API), 
wheather information, news, translation or routing (Google Maps/Directions API).

butler.js is a web application and therefore OS/platform independent. 

Two example use cases are:

 - Usage your phone by using a that supports speech recognition (e.g. Google Chrome for Android)
 - Usage as a home system (e.g. on a Raspberry Pi equiped with microphones and speakers), so you have an onmipresent assisstant
